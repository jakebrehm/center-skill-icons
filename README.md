A simple RuneLite plugin intended to fix the misalignment of icons on the skills panel, an issue exacerbated by the 
introduction of the sailing skill. The issue becomes more noticeable the lower the skill is on the skill panel.

Since each user's perception of "centered" will be different, especially with empty space on the sides of some icons 
creating the illusion of lopsidedness, the positions of the skill icons are configurable in the plugin settings. 
The defaults are set to values that are hopefully good enough out of the box.
